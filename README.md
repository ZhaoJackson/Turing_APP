# 🤖 Turing Test Swipe App

Can you tell which response was written by a human and which was generated by AI?

The **Turing Test Swipe App** is a lightweight, mobile-friendly web app that challenges your intuition. You'll be shown 15 prompts — each with one anonymous response — and you'll swipe right if you think it was written by a human, or left if you think it came from AI.
