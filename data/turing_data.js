    "human": "Bringing it up feels like walking a tightrope--one wrong word, and suddenly, competence is in question. Social work is about helping others, but there's this quiet fear that being in recovery makes someone seem like the one who needs help. So the safer choice is usually silence, even when that silence feels heavy.",
    "ai": "As a future social worker, I'm acutely aware that disclosing my recovery status to a professor could impact their perception of my ability to help others. The fear of judgment gnaws at me, making my heart race every time I consider opening up. I worry that instead of seeing my lived experience as a strength, they might view it as a liability, and this anxiety often leaves me feeling isolated and unable to fully engage in class discussions about addiction and recovery.",

I know they meant well, but it made me feel weird, like I was some kind of charity case instead of just a normal kid. I don't really think of my tics as something I'm \"brave\" for having--they just happen, like blinking or sneezing. It would've been way cooler if they just treated me like everyone else.",
    "ai": "A colleague once insisted on pointing out every instance of my tics during a meeting, claiming they were \"helping me become more aware\" to control them. While their intent may have been supportive, the constant attention amplified my self-consciousness and disrupted my focus. This well-meaning but misguided approach inadvertently reinforced stigma rather than fostering understanding. It highlighted the need for education on the neurological basis of Tourette's and the importance of respecting individual boundaries.",

It's not really a mental illness\u00e2\u20ac\u201dit's more like a spiritual experience, and people usually go to healers or do rituals to feel better. It's kind of hard to explain if you've never heard of it, but it's a big deal in those cultures.

People experience symptoms like dissociation or distress, often linked to spirit possession. Healing involves rituals led by community healers, reflecting deep cultural beliefs.

It's not just about academics; it's about feeling like an outsider in a world that seems tailored for more privileged peers. We're under pressure to fit in and hide our backgrounds, which can be emotionally draining and make it harder to speak up or ask for help. It's like we're constantly worried that any mistake will prove we don't belong.",

When you\u2019ve never been in rooms like this before, every small mistake feels like proof you don\u2019t belong.
